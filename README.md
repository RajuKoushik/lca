# Lowest Common Ancestor

To find LCA between two nodes, use Node class in `node.py`. First step is to create nodes using Node instances. Then use `lca` method to find lowest common ancestor between any of the two nodes in that tree. To see it in action, simply run `main.py` and some LCA sample checks will be outputted.

For now, Node class does not check if nodes are from different trees.
